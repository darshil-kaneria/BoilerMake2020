# musicGenerationAI

Welcome to musicGenerationAI! Generate a music sequence based on the theme of your favourite song. This application is built on Javascript and Python (Keras). The input from the website is taken using the library 'JZZ' and we used an LSTM model (written in Keras) to train our test cases and generate a midi file.

## Run Instructions

1) Upload your midi file to our website. 
2) Hit "play" to generate a brand new music sequence based on the theme of the midi you just uploaded.
